Sorted array
It is arranged in a specific order(ascending to descending or big to small or small to big)

Linear Search
It searches the targeted value one by one in the array 

Binary Search
It splits the array in half by fixing the start and the end value and takes the middle value(m=s+e/2) and search the targeted value
It takes less time 

Time Complexity Big O notation(O-order)
For Linear search-O(n)-number of elements in array
For Binary search-O(log n)
